<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the filling. In a wok, stir-fry each vegetable separately in peanut
    oil. Season with salt and pepper. Drain and transfer to a mixing bowl. Stir
    in noodles, mushroom soy sauce, chili paste, sesame oil, and cilantro.
    Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool completely. When cool, blend
    the filling mixture with the aromatic mixture. When ready to form the spring
    rolls, squeeze out all the excess liquid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the spring rolls. Place about 1/2 cup of prepared filling per spring
    roll wrapper. Roll and seal edges with the egg wash. Repeat the process
    until all filling is used.
  </li>
  <li>
    In a deep pot, with about 4 cups peanut oil heated to 350 degrees F.,
    deep-fry in batches of 4 until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper
    towels. Trim off the ends and slice diagonally. Drizzle top with Hot Chinese
    Mustard Sauce. Serve immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the aromatic mixture. In a food processor, combine the ginger,
    garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes. Turn on machine, slowly add oil
    and process mixture to a puree. Saute mixture for 1 to 2 minutes. Season
    with salt, pepper and sugar. Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Hot Chinese Mustard Sauce. In a bowl, combine all the
    ingredients except the oil. Stir until well blended. Slowly whisk in the
    peanut oil until emulsified. Refrigerate, covered until needed.
