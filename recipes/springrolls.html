  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Prepare the filling. In a wok, stir-fry each vegetable separately in
      peanut oil. Season with salt and pepper. Drain and transfer to a mixing
      bowl. Stir in noodles, mushroom soy sauce, chili paste, sesame oil, and
      cilantro. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside to cool completely. When
      cool, blend the filling mixture with the aromatic mixture. When ready to
      form the spring rolls, squeeze out all the excess liquid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the spring rolls. Place about 1/2 cup of prepared filling per spring
      roll wrapper. Roll and seal edges with the egg wash. Repeat the process
      until all filling is used.
    </li>
    <li>
      In a deep pot, with about 4 cups peanut oil heated to 350 degrees F.,
      deep-fry in batches of 4 until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on
      paper towels. Trim off the ends and slice diagonally. Drizzle top with Hot
      Chinese Mustard Sauce. Serve immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare the aromatic mixture. In a food processor, combine the ginger,
      garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes. Turn on machine, slowly add
      oil and process mixture to a puree. Saute mixture for 1 to 2 minutes.
      Season with salt, pepper and sugar. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prepare the Hot Chinese Mustard Sauce. In a bowl, combine all the
      ingredients except the oil. Stir until well blended. Slowly whisk in the
      peanut oil until emulsified. Refrigerate, covered until needed.
